# Create token for node (workers) to join cluster
# At this point we could copy and paste the join command from the cp node. That command only works for 2 hours, so we will build our own join should we want to add nodes in the future. 
# Find the token on the cp node. The token lasts 2 hours by default. If it has been longer, and no token is present you can generate a new one with the sudo kubeadm token create command

# In cp
sudo kubeadm token list
# Save token for using later
sudo kubeadm token create
